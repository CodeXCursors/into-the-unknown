        <p><span class="secondary">Into The Unknown: The Podcast</span> is a Podcast wherein we would read anonymous messages/confession about a certain topic sent to us. At the end of each confession, we would give a gentle reminder to the sender (this part of the podcast was inspired by a book entitled <span class="secondary">"A Gentle Reminder"</span> which was written by <i>Bianca Sparacino</i>.)</p>
        
        <p>Lastly, after the gentle reminder we will be giving some sour opinions, thoughts, and advice to the sender.</p>
